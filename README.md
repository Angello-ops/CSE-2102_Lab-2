# CSE-2102_Lab-2

This lab involved setting up a Maven project for a Java-based simulation of a hybrid vehicle, which implements both the ElectricInterface and GasolineInterface. The goal of the lab was to convert a basic Java project into a Maven project, manage dependencies through the pom.xml, and write unit tests using the JUnit framework. The project allows for easy compilation and execution of tests via Maven.

The project includes:

Java classes and interfaces for simulating hybrid vehicle functionality.
Unit tests to ensure correct behavior of the HybridVehicle class.
Maven setup for compiling the project and running tests.
